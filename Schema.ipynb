We chose these four entities because we felt like they best described the information contained within the college scorecard database at the student and institution level. InstitutionInformation summarizes key information about the colleges/universities themselves in terms of identifying them, and telling us where they are, what degrees they offer, and other information about the university itself. StudentBody tells us overall information about the student body at each institution such as demographics, what their scores are, how many part time studnts there are, how much is spent on each student, and information about how much tuition students pay and what their degree completion rates are. Debt tells us summary statistics for how indebted students at each institution are (broken out by demographics) and what student default rates are. StudentOutcomes tells us about how students at each institution do after graduating or leaving school in terms of their salaries and employment outcomes. \n",
